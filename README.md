# BeyondTesting.dev

**BeyondTesting.dev** is about writing software that verifies itself.

It focuses on **Design by Contract (DbC)** — using preconditions, postconditions, and invariants to define what code expects, guarantees, and maintains.

This repository contains the source for the site.

## Why this exists

Most development processes treat correctness as something to verify after the fact.

This project looks at how correctness can be built in — using contracts, not just tests.

It documents how different languages approach Design by Contract, and presents the core ideas visually.

## Contributing

This is not an open project in the general sense.

If you care about contracts, compilers, or correctness — especially if you want to help translate content into other languages — you're welcome to fork it or open an issue.
