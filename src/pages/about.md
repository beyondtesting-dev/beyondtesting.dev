# About BeyondTesting.dev

**BeyondTesting.dev** explores how software can be correct _by design_, not just through testing.

It focuses on **Design by Contract (DbC)**, a methodology that embeds correctness into code through preconditions, postconditions, and invariants.

This isn't a testing library. It's a mindset shift.

## Why this site exists

Most developers spend their careers chasing correctness with tests. Writing them. Updating them. Rewriting them.

> We’re not here to chase correctness. We’re here to design it in from the start.

**BeyondTesting.dev stands for correctness, clarity, and a refusal to settle.**

BeyondTesting.dev shows how **contracts** can do just that — through clear diagrams, real code examples, and language-native support.

> **Design by Contract originated in [Bertrand Meyer](https://bertrandmeyer.com/)'s book _Object-Oriented Software Construction_ (1992).**  
> It formalized preconditions, postconditions, and invariants — not as documentation, but as _executable guarantees_.  
> The Eiffel programming language was the first to enforce these principles by design.
