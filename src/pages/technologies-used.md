# Technologies used

XFrames leverages a variety of cutting-edge technologies to deliver high-performance, GPU-accelerated, cross-platform applications. Each technology plays a crucial role in ensuring that the library offers seamless integration, native performance, and flexibility for developers. Below is a detailed list of the key tools, frameworks, and libraries that power XFrames, helping developers build fast, modern GUIs without sacrificing performance or cross-platform compatibility.

## Dear ImGui

At the heart of XFrames lies [Dear ImGui](https://github.com/ocornut/imgui), a powerful, battle-tested immediate-mode GUI library. It provides developers with unparalleled control and flexibility to design high-performance user interfaces. 
Notably, Dear ImGui supports (among many others) [GLFW](https://www.glfw.org/) + [OpenGL](https://www.opengl.org/) and GLFW + [WebGPU](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WebGPU) rendering out of the box, making it a versatile choice for modern applications.
Combined with supporting technologies like [Implot](https://github.com/epezent/implot) for data visualization, [IconFontCppHeaders](https://github.com/juliettef/IconFontCppHeaders) for iconography, and [Stb's Image Loader](https://github.com/nothings/stb/blob/master/stb_image.h) for image textures, Dear ImGui empowers XFrames to deliver GPU-accelerated GUI experiences.

## Core programming languages

### C++

C++ is the backbone of XFrames, providing low-level performance and the flexibility needed to build fast, high-performance applications. By leveraging C++, XFrames can offer fine-grained control over memory and system resources, essential for rendering GUIs and handling complex tasks like real-time data processing and map rendering.

### C

The wrapper library used by other languages such as Python, OCaml, Lua, Ada, Crystal, D, Fortran, and .NET languages (such as C# and F#) has been written in C.
The Java Native Interface library to enable compatibility with JVM languages such as Java, Kotlin and Scala has also been written in C.

## Rendering
