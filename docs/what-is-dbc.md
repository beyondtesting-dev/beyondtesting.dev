# What is Design by Contract?

**Design by Contract (DbC)** is a way of writing code that *documents and enforces its own expectations* ‚Äî not just through comments or tests, but through executable conditions.

At its core, DbC defines three things for every function or method:

- **Preconditions** ‚Äî What must be true *before* it runs
- **Postconditions** ‚Äî What it guarantees *after* it runs
- **Invariants** ‚Äî What must *always* be true for an object

Think of it like a legal contract between different parts of your code:  
_"I promise to give you valid input, you promise to do your job and leave things in a valid state."_

## Why should you care?

Because **contracts catch bugs where they happen** ‚Äî at the boundaries of logic.

Instead of writing 50 tests hoping to cover every edge case, DbC makes your program **self-verifying**. It tells you *immediately* when something breaks its promise.

Less testing. More trust.

## How does it compare to testing?

| | Traditional Tests | Design by Contract |
|--|-------------------|--------------------|
| ‚úÖ Finds bugs | Yes | Yes |
| üß† Documents assumptions | Sometimes | Always |
| üß™ Requires test cases | Yes | Not always |
| ‚ö†Ô∏è Fails at runtime | Yes | Yes (but sooner) |
| üîÅ Needs maintenance | Yes | Minimal |

They‚Äôre not mutually exclusive ‚Äî but DbC can **replace a large chunk of your testing**, especially for internal logic.

---

## Isn‚Äôt this just input validation?

No. Input validation protects from user mistakes.  
Contracts protect from **developer mistakes** ‚Äî violations of your own logic.

DbC enforces trust *within your codebase*. That‚Äôs what makes it powerful.

## Where can I see it in action?

These languages have **native support** for Design by Contract ‚Äî it‚Äôs built into the compiler or core runtime, not bolted on with libraries or frameworks:

- [**Eiffel**](./eiffel): the birthplace of Design by Contract. Contracts are part of the language‚Äôs identity and enforced by default.
- [**Ada**](./ada): includes preconditions, postconditions, and invariants as part of the language (since Ada 2012), with formal support in SPARK for critical systems.
- [**D**](https://dlang.org/spec/contracts.html): supports `in` and `out` contracts directly in function declarations, making DbC a natural part of the development process.
- [**Racket**](https://docs.racket-lang.org/reference/contracts.html): offers a contract system deeply integrated into the language. Contracts are first-class values and can be applied to functions, data structures, classes, and modules ‚Äî enabling full preconditions, postconditions, and invariants at runtime.

In other ecosystems, particularly Python, Design by Contract is implemented via **third-party libraries**:

- [**icontract**](https://github.com/Parquery/icontract): a dedicated DbC library for Python with support for preconditions, postconditions, and invariants using decorators.
- [**deal**](https://github.com/life4/deal): a contract library that supports runtime checks and even static analysis.

These tools can bring contract-like behavior into Python, but enforcement remains **opt-in**, and integration with the language/runtime is limited compared to native solutions.
