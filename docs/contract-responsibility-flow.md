# Who’s Responsible?

Design by Contract doesn’t just catch bugs — it tells you **who is responsible** when something breaks.

Contracts make it clear:

- **Preconditions** must be satisfied by the **caller**
- **Postconditions** and **invariants** must be upheld by the **callee**

If a contract fails, the blame isn’t vague — it’s built into the system.
